        <h1 class="h1 pb-3">Why professional certification matters?</h1>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Validation of Skills and Knowledge:</strong> Certifications provide a standardized way to validate
                an individual&#39;s skills and knowledge in a specific field. They demonstrate that the certified
                person has met a certain level of expertise and competency.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Credibility and Trust:</strong> Holding a recognized certification lends credibility to your professional
                profile. It helps employers, clients, and colleagues trust your capabilities, as certifications are
                often backed by reputable organizations or industry bodies.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Career Advancement:</strong> Many employers consider certifications when making hiring,
                promotion, or salary decisions. Having relevant certifications can give you a competitive
                edge, helping you stand out in a crowded job market and increasing your chances of career
                growth.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Industry Recognition:</strong> Certifications are often developed in collaboration with industry
                experts and organizations. Holding a certification signifies that you are aligned with industry
                best practices and standards.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Stay Current:</strong> Certifications often have associated communities and events
                where certified professionals can connect and share insights. This provides valuable
                networking opportunities and a chance to learn from peers.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Professional Development:</strong> Some certifications are recognized internationally, allowing
                professionals to pursue opportunities in different regions or even globally.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Networking Opportunities:</strong> Certifications can also help individuals transition into new roles or
                industries by providing evidence of relevant skills, even if their previous experience is from a
                different field.
            </li>
